# Cakebot

# Contributing
For now, only enhancements to the current modules are accepted as pull request,
if you want to write a new module, I recommend adding an issue first, asking
for the new module.

# AI module
AI (Not really AI), is a module that responds to english messages. And will be the main
function of cakebot. This is a huge task, but I find it lots of fun, feel free to
contribute to this module.
